				<h2 class="alt">Smart Movable Trash-Bin With Trash Identification in Office</h2>
				<p>Smart Movable Trash-Bin (SMTB) is an IoT solution to current trash sorting problem in office.
					Currently, the trash sorting is a trend and a remedial action to save the environment, which
					becomes a policy of great significance in numerous countries and cities. However, people, especially
					the officer in office, who are not going to have a single trash-bin suffers
					from the trash sorting and often feel confused about the trash type every time they are going to
					drop trash. Our project aims to automate
					the process in the origin, which means when people drop trash, the trash is accurately identifed as
					the trash type, including metal, plastic, glass, paper, cardboard (recyclable in most regions)
					and trash (unrecyclable). In addition, our target is to make it as a intelligent project.
					Since in most cases, officers should share a common trash-bin and need to move when they have trash.
					But
					with our design, user can directly use phone to call our SMTB to come to his/her postion and user
					can
					simply put trash in and SMTB intelligently identify the trash type and go back orginal place for
					sorting and collecting.
				</p>
				<p>
					With SMTB, officers will benefit from simplification of dropping trash and trash sorting; office
					will become more clean; government will benefit from the energy conservation resulting from resource
					reuse.
					We hope our project will make a difference to the world.

					2019 has witnessed the stablishment of compulsary trash-sorting policy in many major
					cities in China and USA. Our self-trash-sorting trash-bin will help people figure out the correct
					sort of
					trash. It will save people's time and also avoid the incorrect-sorting case.</p>

				<img src="https://www.simplehuman.com/media/wysiwyg/feature-chapter/rectangular-sensor-can2-sensor-D.jpg"
					style="width:500px;height:300px;">
				<p align="left">Smart house and office products like smart sweepers have become popular theses days.
					While most smart trash-bin products in market fail to provide user-friendly and fully automative
					service but
					only with functions of great confinement such as auto-opening using voice or movition sensor, our
					project is going to provide a new perspective.
				</p>


				<p align="left">
					Our motivation fully automating the trash collecting and sorting stimulates us to
					create SMTB.
				</p>

				<p align="left">
					The SMTB designed by us still resembles the use logic of theses product to make all functions
					accessible from phone. However,
					we manage to make the trash collecting and trash sorting automated in SMTB.
					When user use the phone to call SMTB, it will immediately approach users once there is no other
					unfinished command.
					Then it will collect the trash and identify the trash type. At the same time, SMTB will come back to
					the original place
					for battery charging, trash collection and waiting for the next command.
					We hope SMTB provides user-friendly enough service for users.

					<h2>System</h2>
				</header>

				<h3 align="left">Architecture</h3>

				<p align="left"></p>
				<img src="images/architecture.png" style="width:500px;height:300px;">


				<h3 align="left">Technical Components</h3>


				<p align="left">
					There are three main technical components:
				</p>

				<strong>
					<h4>APP Design</h4>
				</strong>
				</br>
				<img src="./images/app1.jpeg" style="width:150px;height:300px;">
				<p align="left">
					We used Android Studio to develop a phone APP. There are two functions along with 3 layouts. When
					the APP is launched, users will see the homepage with two buttons on it. One is used to redirected
					to take_photo layout, the other is used to call_trash_can layout.
				</p>
				<img src="./images/app1.jpeg" style="width:150px;height:300px;">
				<p align="left">
					Take_photo layout is the page where users can identify the type of trash without calling the
					trash-can. Just take a photo and upload it to server, the result will be shown on the page. Clicking
					the HOME button can redirected to home page.

				</p>
				<img src="./images/app1.jpeg" style="width:150px;height:300px;">
				<p align="left">
					Call_trash_can will interact with the trash-can. Users enter his position and click request button,
					server will handle this request. The response status received from server will be displayed on this
					page. If the response is "successful", the trash-can will come.
				</p>

				<strong>
					<h4>Server Design</h4>
				</strong>
				</br>
				<img src="./images/server.png" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
				<p align="left">
					The server is built by Django and there are '/recommend', '/identify', '/acceptCommand'
					and '/actCommand'. We make it public in the internet using ngrok. Then trash identification model
					is set up to identify the trash type of incoming images.
				</p>
				<p align="left">
					The image taken by phone can be post through '/recommend' to server. The server will save the image
					and load the trash identification model to obtain the result and return the result to the app of
					smart phone.
				</p>
				<img src="./images/ESP8266.png" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
				<p align="left">
					Due to limit of budget and time, the camera and ESP8266 in SMTB have a not good as enough
					performance in photo taking,
					which can only take a image and transfer every 10 bytes to the server. So after taking photo,
					ESP8266 will upload the image to
					server through '/identify'. Our server is going to take around 2 minutes
					to receive the whole image and then convert it to a real image from bytes. The results of
					identification will be saved for
					trash sorting.
				</p>
				<p align="left">
					Besides, ESP8266 board listens to '/actCommand' in a fixed frequency (currently 3 seconds/ 1 cycle)
					to know whether or not there is new command from users. Once it detects the command,
					it will interact with STM32 in the car to deliver the instruction. Then the car will follow the
					instruction, such as "move to position A"
					("A" is a calibrated position in office map), to find a path to the required position.
				</p>
				<p align="left">
					In addition to the connection between server and SMTB, there is definitely a connection between
					server and user.
					The user can directly uses the app in the phone. The sent command will be stored in server and
					server will return the status of
					command processing situation to let user know if the command can be processed or not.
				</p>
				<p align="left">
					Our trash identification model is built using tensorflow and model Inception-V3 architecture.
					The top layer receives as input a 2048-dimensional vector for each image. We
					train a softmax layer on top of this representation. Assuming the softmax layer
					contains N labels, this corresponds to learning N + 2048 * N model parameters
					corresponding to the learned biases and weights. We define the subfolder names as the label.
					Also, we use scrapy and beautiful soap to collect images based on the trash type to server as part
					of
					training set. Furthermore, we also collect samples and loads part of images as training set.
				</p>




				<strong>
					<h4>Car Design</h4>
				</strong>
				</br>

				<p align="left">
					The car has two parts, a trash can and an
					omnidirectional chassis.
				</p>
				<p align="left">
					The trash can has an OV2640 camera on its top to take the
					picture of the trash. We use an ESP8266 board to read the camera with SPI
					protocol and upload the image to the server.
				</p>
				<p align="left">
					To realize omnidirectional movement, we use four Mecanum
					wheels so that it’s much more easier for the trash can to navigate, avoid
					obstacle and adjust its attitude. However, due to the budget limits, the whole
					chassis is controlled only by a STM32F407 board so theoretically the timer and
					uart is not enough for the whole chassis. As a result, all four motors are
					open-loop controlled. Only the chassis has a position closed-loop control which
					means the navigation is harded.
				</p>
				<img src="./images/car_design.png" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
				<p align="left">
					We build a localization system with two orthogonal placed
					encoders and an IMU, which gives the chassis its acceleration, speed, position
					and attitude. Since manufacturing methods are limited to laser engraving and 3D
					printer, we cannot make a robust encoder system. So we failed to narrow the
					localization error with a better algorithm based on non-orthogonal arranged
					encoders and very accurate calibration.
				</p>




				<h3 align="left">Prototype</h3>

				<img src="./images/prototype.jpeg" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
				<p align="left">
					The prototype was built with the combination of a car and trash bin on the top.
				</p>
				<img src="./images/server_prototype.png" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
				<p align="left">
					The server is temporarily public in the internet by ngrok.
				</p>
				<img src="./images/app_prototype1.png" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
				<img src="./images/app_prototype2.png" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
				<p align="left">
					The app is built by Android Studio.

					<h2>Results</h2>
				</header>

				<img src="./images/result_1.png" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
				<p align="left">
					We have completed most parts of our wish list.
				</p>

				<img src="./images/result_2.png" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
				<p align="left">
					And we nearly reach Gold outcome except the obstacle avoiding.
				</p>

				<img src="./images/result_4.png" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
				<p align="left">
					We have overcome most important and difficult problem.
				</p>

				<img src="./images/result_3.png" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
				<p align="left">
					The accuracy of trash identification in training set and validation set
					reaches up to 87%. And it can accurately identify the trash type in images regardless of 
					being from phone or camera on SMTB.
				</p>

				<p align="left">
					The car has a stable and accurate localization as shown in the demo video.
				</p>

				<p align="left">
					The phone can simply take a photo of trash and display the identified trash type.
					Also, it allows user to monitor the SMTB and send command to SMTB to process.
